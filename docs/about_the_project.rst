About the Project
=================

**Meetro** is an innovative web service designed to simplify the process of finding a central meeting location for friends or groups spread across a metropolitan area. By leveraging cutting-edge technology and current attraction data, Meetro calculates the optimal midpoint subway station and recommends nearby popular destinations to enhance the meetup experience.

Purpose and Objectives
----------------------
The primary goal of Meetro is to provide a seamless and enjoyable way to plan meetups at central locations by:

- **Simplifying the Planning Process**: Calculate an optimal subway midpoint for all participants.
- **Enhancing the Experience**: Recommend nearby attractions based on popularity and relevance, making meetups more enjoyable.

Problem Identification and Analysis
-----------------------------------
Coordinating meetups with friends in different locations is often challenging. Existing tools like **WeMeetPlace** and **Ya-manna** attempt to address this issue but fall short in key areas:

- **WeMeetPlace**: While this platform identifies midpoints, it often lacks updated or desirable attractions near the suggested locations.
- **Ya-manna**: Although this tool includes entertainment options, it prioritizes exact midpoints, which may not align with users' preferences for enjoyable destinations.

Meetro bridges these gaps by combining midpoint calculations with a scoring system that prioritizes popular attractions, providing a more practical and appealing solution.

Research and Improvement Opportunities
--------------------------------------
To ensure Meetro offers a superior experience, we analyzed similar platforms:

- **WeMeetPlace** (Website | GitHub): Lacks comprehensive, updated attraction data near midpoints.
- **Ya-manna** (Website | GitHub): Overemphasizes strict midpoint calculations, sometimes overlooking better nearby options.

By addressing these limitations, Meetro provides an experience tailored to users seeking enjoyable meeting locations with current attraction data.

Key Features
------------
Meetroâ€™s unique scoring system ensures users are recommended a central subway station with the best nearby attractions. 

**Core Functionalities**:  
1. **Midpoint Calculation with Flexible Range**:  
   Prioritize stations with nearby attractions within a flexible midpoint range.

2. **Attraction Weighting**:  
   Assign higher weights to popular attractions (e.g., amusement parks, malls) for better recommendations.

3. **Station Scoring**:  
   Evaluate subway stations based on proximity to the midpoint and attraction ratings.

4. **Optimized Recommendations**:  
   Suggest stations with the highest scores for a balanced mix of convenience and enjoyment.
