# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us privately. Security issues should not be publicly disclosed until they are reviewed and resolved.

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to [11yyyy1733@naver.com](mailto:11yyyy1733@naver.com) with the following details:

1. **Description of the issue**
2. **Steps to reproduce the issue**
3. **Potential impact and severity**
4. **Any suggestions for fixing the issue**

Our team will respond to security reports within 48 hours. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will take steps to address it, keeping the reporter informed throughout the process.

## Disclosure Policy

After a vulnerability has been fixed, we will work with the reporter to determine a reasonable disclosure schedule. Our goal is to balance transparency with the need to protect users.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure!
