# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
The Meetro team and community take security bugs in Meetro seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it to us privately. Security issues should not be publicly disclosed until they are reviewed and resolved.

To report a vulnerability, please send an email to [11yyyy1733@naver.com](mailto:11yyyy1733@naver.com)with the following details:

1. **Description of the issue**
2. **Steps to reproduce the issue**
3. **Potential impact and severity**
4. **Any suggestions for fixing the issue**

Our team will respond to security reports within 24 hours. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will take steps to address it, keeping the reporter informed throughout the process.
if emailing is difficuly, you can also try [our own chatbot](https://open.kakao.com/o/sIczM5Yg).

## Disclosure Policy

After a vulnerability has been fixed, we will work with the reporter to determine a reasonable disclosure schedule. Our goal is to balance transparency with the need to protect users.

Thank you for helping us keep this project secure!
